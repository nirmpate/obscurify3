You can start exploring an artist's discography, spend an hour in the world they've created, take a look at the clock and wonder where the time went.

This might be your fate if you start up Raveena's catalog. Over the course of a full-length album, 2 EPs, and a handful of singles, Raveena has shown her consistent vision and ability to transport the listener to a lush, loving, and dreamy place with incredibly warm layered vocals, wide electric piano, tastefully funky bass tightly fitting over subdued drums, and jazz-inspired guitars gliding overtop.

The [2018 Camp Flog Gnaw](https://earmilk.com/2018/11/14/6-standout-up-and-coming-acts-from-this-years-camp-flog-gnaw-carnival/) performer's live shows are filled with the same energy. In between songs on her appearance on [NPR's Tiny Desk](https://www.youtube.com/embed/pre9lE3Wa78), she says:

> In any live space that I do, I want to cultivate this feeling of softness in the room, and community... And create a sense of togetherness, and a sense of love and vulnerability.

Please enjoy the following small sampling of excellent tracks across her catalog. 


# If Only

Raveena's biggest hit thus far, "If Only" is an irresistable slow jam with bouncing bass, layered guitar, and a smooth, swelling electic piano.
Her vocals effortlessly fly into falsetto and backing vox provide a warm embrace of harmony. Singing along to the chorus, you can't help bopping your head too.

> It's too late to hold me, too late to call me too
<br/>You're saying "if only I could get over you"


# Stone

Much more melancholy than the previous song, Raveena shows a more vulnerable side of herself. Slightly detuned, yearning guitar chords call out overtop the downtempo drum and bass. Her lyrics paint a picture of love lost and the difficulty of overcoming once-joyful memories.

> Six months from now, it’ll be the summertime
<br/>By then I’ll forget what it’s like to have you on my mind


# Headaches

Evolving across five minutes, "Headaches" captures the positive and negative feelings of a new romance. The impressive production will have you seamlessly following along.


# Sweet Time

Combining a magnificent harp with a biting bass and electic piano, "Sweet Time" has an upbeat groove that just might make you put on your dancing shoes.


# Tweety

Raveena's latest song (and cover image) has a distinctly '90s aesthetic, and there's more of an 808-inspired bass and drum sound this time around. What didn't change is her ear for amazingly catchy melodies and bright harmonies. If this track is any indication, I'm excited to see where she will take her music from here on.
