# Neo Jessica Joshua, or Nao, is someone who's quite the outlier in the UK Electronic R&B scene. 

Her music isn't normally the usual electronic production with R&B vocals like James Blake, Jack Garratt, or SOHN make. So, where does she fit into the scene? Before we answer that question, you all may recognize Nao from her features, [Firefly (Mura Masa's Mura Masa)](https://open.spotify.com/track/2s9C5THb9llwyVXtjveV4E?si=UFm-ZGTgTNmeQCU3hGwIlQ) and [Superego (Disclosure's Caracal)](https://open.spotify.com/track/4vd7KzctkhCVCUnCCyoO0d?si=nj1G8PPxSsi-D-7Kj2T25A).


What makes Nao an outlier in the UK Electronic Alternative R&B wave is her sound. Instead of the usual subtle, smooth, heavy bass, reverberated sound, Nao takes a more livelier and bouncy approach for her style of Alternative R&B. Nao describes her sound as "wonky funk". Wonky is a style of electronic music, that uses of-beat hip-hop rhythms and combines them with elements of dubstep or IDM. Nao combining funk with Wonky is what gives her music that lively bouncy sound that you won't see with artists like [Roses Gabor](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2gcdX1NqiPU2F4QxSlBo7r?si=4icFECdmTqSB7e9MJjGBuQ), [Szjerdene](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5WcgyMkdfILvNCPTavIINv?si=-lpasD0hSIGoshhtlagxIw), or [Fka Twigs](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6nB0iY1cjSY1KyhYyuIIKH?si=MdQSL9GsRWKEEGideK-3cQ). A few of her songs that fit that lively, bouncy sound would be [Good Girl](https://open.spotify.com/track/6bl1EIJjAAmot2ya5lfYyv?si=eVIoP2NIRwa5G9Vp53NmsA), [Get to Know Ya](https://open.spotify.com/track/7coWZzFEyhoZTcMfZixvwB?si=o8-2WnGWQm2vCenw-ZtD0A), and [Trophy](https://open.spotify.com/track/4wfruBEWWb0iYHbMRd01GA?si=Q3uGLTWqTmyamPwGBjQ59A).

Nao's music also incorporates sounds like funk guitars ([So Good](https://open.spotify.com/track/5JfzG6442R2JvJXBDfUXZW?si=AFoSWaN3T_K0do_McrXCdg), [Happy](https://open.spotify.com/track/6MeRDLBZfPRZudEmJhbuj6?si=OrZIyUqfQ_qlFnnHV0YU7w)), distorted instruments ([Fool to Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/0uII79GWhvmTIvruhfIXlf?si=kRSHTJ7iReSDgjrGp0ECiA), [Another Lifetime](https://open.spotify.com/track/48WTGGIeSFD5ZMF51Rm4Y9?si=6kXlpiMnSLSNClikbbptxQ)), tribal beats ([If You Ever](https://open.spotify.com/track/5PkZ0mhNgfuz7SqiuruKlh?si=_8PURuJRT8qgZ8M8UILC0g)), industrial music ([In the Morning](https://open.spotify.com/track/3pRyeZCIGdaO84RSBj9Bj7?si=hVOjCafhQ_imoIsiEVJZvw)), Afrobeats ([Drive and Disconnect](https://open.spotify.com/track/6pEAd0UjznaKABT7WLLvmC?si=lPkDggfDTQ-QYR3V1ZZmOw), [Antidote](https://open.spotify.com/track/1ndeyZurGdaWqLh3srX0ia?si=RZS975FAQFmpcdZrYXV8KA)), and off beat rhythms ([Make it Out Alive](https://open.spotify.com/track/0VXinRGqxFxr1BKrOrC9pP?si=MkNayK4XTS6rIEwQTH0K3g), [Gabriel](https://open.spotify.com/track/5fp8Ww74MLFXjCYRxf6YMt?si=n8BXR_iqSziZXrkQE0xeuw), [Inhale Exhale](https://open.spotify.com/track/2fv00qmva1kpCctrKgoIer?si=WJuOiaOdSGGATmGeZgC5ag)). Occasionally, Nao's music will follow the usual subtle, smooth, heavy bass style of Alternative R&B as seen in [It's You](https://open.spotify.com/track/0trHY8tLVJ7Vtkp3DwW6Uo?si=T9DNpnXxQpqk1nm_yMv7sg), [Apple Cherry](https://open.spotify.com/track/10XxTowGnHIAYqS6FMTe60?si=G7ear6sYQkepYXQKJkBWrg), and [Blue Wine](https://open.spotify.com/track/40CrAsHK8vJIAHX6AxZWUi?si=yz-69Ak3Q_mxXWwU0rn4aA).

Another thing that makes Nao an outlier is her singing voice. Her voice is one of the most recognizable in R&B music. Her singing voice is very high pitched. It even sounds like it's computer generated, but let me tell you, it's all real. If you don't believe me, then watch the live performance of Drive and Disconnect.

Nao also knows how to use her massive range. She even puts it on full display like in [Bad Blood](https://open.spotify.com/track/4Iam3vZMJCMltFkK9mNruw?si=Gb-ZmqEeTta6mUC0Rsf2tQ) and [Love Supreme](https://open.spotify.com/track/591qGFsTHMPHQ9V6lz4CKJ?si=9AMfH7ShRpSfEprI2OZBhw). She can hit high notes like in [Apple Cherry](https://open.spotify.com/track/10XxTowGnHIAYqS6FMTe60?si=G7ear6sYQkepYXQKJkBWrg), low notes like in in [Orbit](https://open.spotify.com/track/5yrXolC7Un3peiFxwqbucn?si=FHwUdYfATQWngONZUMU2rw), or hit both along with the middle in the same song like in [A Life Like This](https://open.spotify.com/track/7c8bCcNTQTx13FkjtKkb8E?si=0V2bAOWhRjm5JVGLv66Mng). When Nao sings, she often has her voice follow the production in the song. If you listen to [Inhale Exhale](https://open.spotify.com/track/2fv00qmva1kpCctrKgoIer?si=WJuOiaOdSGGATmGeZgC5ag)), [Golden](https://open.spotify.com/track/5OGuFkKqUqvYeaUTbarFBl?si=6mXzPBxBTNmbB_L-RNxuPQ), [Give Me a Little](https://open.spotify.com/track/6lB0UsHu3sWupDfYXJ9VH2?si=g8D9Bd5kTHWUGABtOxcv0g), or [Fool to Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/0uII79GWhvmTIvruhfIXlf?si=u4ySFrCDQqeLmUsllwu8dA), you can get a full picture of it.

Nao's singing style is based on vocal jazz. You can clearly tell from her phrasing, ad libs ([Inhale Exhale](https://open.spotify.com/track/2fv00qmva1kpCctrKgoIer?si=WJuOiaOdSGGATmGeZgC5ag)), [Golden](https://open.spotify.com/track/5OGuFkKqUqvYeaUTbarFBl?si=6mXzPBxBTNmbB_L-RNxuPQ), [Gabriel](https://open.spotify.com/track/5fp8Ww74MLFXjCYRxf6YMt?si=n8BXR_iqSziZXrkQE0xeuw)), and improvisations that her major influences are jazz singers. As amazing as Nao's singing voice is, what also works for her is her songwriting ability. Her songwriting may not seems amazing at first, but for her singing style, it fits perfectly. It is almost as if she bases her lyrics on the production of her songs then allows her singing voice to follow suit. Some of Nao's best lyrics can be seen in [Orbit](https://open.spotify.com/track/5yrXolC7Un3peiFxwqbucn?si=FHwUdYfATQWngONZUMU2rw), [Saturn](https://open.spotify.com/track/7HHlagS4aGF82LduE2FoY4?si=xXq0FZcCTA-0HkRZM6R7gQ), [Blue Wine](https://open.spotify.com/track/40CrAsHK8vJIAHX6AxZWUi?si=yz-69Ak3Q_mxXWwU0rn4aA), [Bad Blood](https://open.spotify.com/track/4Iam3vZMJCMltFkK9mNruw?si=Gb-ZmqEeTta6mUC0Rsf2tQ), [It's You](https://open.spotify.com/track/0trHY8tLVJ7Vtkp3DwW6Uo?si=T9DNpnXxQpqk1nm_yMv7sg), and [Adore You](https://open.spotify.com/track/25isxLhIKV8lNSecmvY700?si=4o5FKajlTxCj2a70K_vN_Q).

If you are in the mood for Nao's "wonky funk" sound check out her projects [So Good - EP](https://open.spotify.com/album/24Mvai61eMmHgDm2jtPkgL?si=NoYW1uhkQOGtTKOyfmzcgA) and [For All We Know](https://open.spotify.com/album/2BmceJHiy9RTyvaB1IU0P6?si=5T_XvSOGSqmMHZ91CBC7Bw). If you want something more atmospheric, but still having the "wonky funk" sound, listen to her project [February 15](https://open.spotify.com/album/6iI212DhxMBlaIHfU0yeH5?si=242bQfhDRvm-q_RTScJROw). If you want something that less on the electronic side, but a good mix of Contemporary and Alternative R&B, listen to [Saturn](https://open.spotify.com/album/5rojZ5uUIKKkfNsFT92Vld?si=M22hQPiaQ-mmza38o4Hm7Q).
