        <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
        <p>
          For a better experience, while using our service,
          we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information,
          which we store on Amazon Web Service's DynamoDB.
          This information is limited to a user's Spotify user ID, their country,
          and the Spotify IDs of their top 50 tracks and artists,
          and is obtained via Spotify's API. This information is not shared with
          any person or organization or used in any purpose other than to aggregate by Obscurify to
          find an average score that a user can compare their own to.

          when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse cookies,
