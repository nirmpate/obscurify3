          Privacy Policy

        <p>
          Alex Olivero and Nirmal Patel built Obscurify as an open source app.
          This service is provided by us at no cost and is intended for use as is.
          This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection,
          use, and disclosure of information if anyone decided to use my service.
          If you choose to use the service, then you agree to the collection and use of
          information in relation to this policy. The information that I collect
          is used for providing and improving the service. I will not use or share your
          information with anyone except as described in this policy.
        </p>
        <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
        <p>
          For a better experience, while using our service,
          we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information,
          which we store on Amazon Web Service's DynamoDB.
          This information is limited to a user's Spotify user ID, their country,
          and the Spotify IDs of their top 50 tracks and artists,
          and is obtained via Spotify's API. This information is not shared with
          any person or organization or used in any purpose other than to aggregate by Obscurify to
          find an average score that a user can compare their own to.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a user opts to share their profile, they will receive a unique URL which they can send to others.
            As part of this service, Obscurify will conditionally collect the user's first name and profile image URL from Spotify,
            provided that Spotify already has that information.
            The user is able to turn off the setting and remove others' access to view their profile at any time,
            where then the user's name and image URL are deleted from Obscurify.
        </p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>

          Obscurify uses a cookie to maintain your login state.

          when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse cookies,
          you may not be able to use some portions of this service.
